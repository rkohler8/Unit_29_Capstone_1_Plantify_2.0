# Project Ideas

1. <b>Home Garden Plant/Herb Tracker</b> (<u>Preferred Idea!!</u>):

      * Create an account
      * Search for plants they are interested in or are already growing
      * Create a “Garden” list that they can save those plants to
      * A “Garden” view will show watering details, difficulty of growing, and other relevant details
      * View other users gardens
      * Maybe save plants as “Favorites”?
